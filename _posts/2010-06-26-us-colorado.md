Drupalcamp Colorado 2010 was an amazing event.

We had over 300 people attend the event, 36 sessions across two days, 1 great code sprint, a coding room throughout the camp, visitors from as far away as Boulder, Nederland, New York, France and The Netherlands, and all sorts of amazing Drupally goodness.
