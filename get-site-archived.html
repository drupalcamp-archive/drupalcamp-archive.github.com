<h2>Getting your site archived</h2>
<p>It's really simple to get your site archived and listed in the Drupalcamp archive:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a static, flat HTML version of your site.</li>
  <li>Ask us to host the site and add the site to the archive pages.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Create a static copy of your site</h3>

<p>There are comprehensive instructions on how to create a static copy of your existing site on Drupal.org, but the goal here is to end up with a static site contained in a folder somewhere.</p>

<p>Important things to note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You should not use any special htaccess rules or tricks.</li>
  <li>You should make sure there's an 'index.html' at the root of your static site's folder structure.</li>
  <li>There should be no forms on the site, like search forms or registration forms.</li>
  <li>You should add a simple message to the top of the site saying that the site has been archived.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Getting the site hosted and added to the archive</h3>

<p>We use Github to host the sites, which they provide for free! All you need to do is add your static site to a new github repo, and then ask us to fork it, provide some extra details for the archive listing and we can add your site.</p>
